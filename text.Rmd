# Text and Labels

Let's continue with the subset of the data from the previous section and add text to the scatterplot.

```{r}
ggplot(housing2001q1, aes(x = Land.Value, y = Structure.Cost)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = State))
```

The result isn't very nice as the labels overlap each other. Let's try the same with `geom_label()` instead which draws the text with a border around it.

```{r}
ggplot(housing2001q1, aes(x = Land.Value, y = Structure.Cost)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_label(aes(label = State))
```

The `ggrepel` extension we loaded earlier can also help fix this problem.

```{r}
ggplot(housing2001q1, aes(x = Land.Value, y = Structure.Cost)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = State))
```

And we can repel the labels with a border using `geom_label_repel()`.

```{r}
ggplot(housing2001q1, aes(x = Land.Value, y = Structure.Cost)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = State))
```
