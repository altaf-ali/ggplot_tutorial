# Basic Plots

## Loading ggplot2

Like any other R package, you must load `ggplot2` using the `library` function before you can use any of the functionality that it offers. We will also load the extensions that provide additional features:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggthemes)
library(scales)
```

## Dataset 

Let's start by loading the housing dataset:

```{r}
housing <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/altaf-ali/ggplot_tutorial/master/data/housing.csv")
```

Now, let's see what the dataset looks like:

```{r}
head(housing)
```

When dealing with date and time values, it's generally a good idea to convert them to the appropriate data type. 

```{r}
housing$Date <- as.Date(housing$Date)
```

Next, we create two subsets of the data, one with housing prices only from New York, and another one with housing prices from 9 states in the North East.

```{r}
newyork <- subset(housing, State == "NY")
northeast <- subset(housing, Region == "N. East")
```

## Scatter Plot

Now we're ready to plot. Everything starts with the `ggplot()` function which creates a plot object. The two arguments passed to `ggplot()` are:

|Argument |Description|
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|`data`   |Dataset for the plot. It should be a data.frame or something that can be converted to data.frame|
|`mapping`|Aesthetic mappings for the plot|

Using the `newyork` dataset, let's create a scatter plot with `Date` on the x-axis and `Home.Value` on the y-axis.

```{r}
ggplot(newyork, aes(x = Date, y = Home.Value)) +
  geom_point()
```

Now let's see which ggplot building blocks are active in the above example:

|       |    |
|-------|----|
|Data   |`newyork`|
|Mapping|`aes(x = Date, y = Home.Value)`|
|Geom   |`geom_point()`|

## Exercise

Use the [Data Visualization with ggplot2 Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) or any other resource to find out how to complete the exercises.

1. Create a histogram of `Home.Value` using the `housing` data.

    ```{r echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(housing, aes(x = Home.Value)) +
      geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000)
    ```

1. Create a box plot of `Home.Value` using `northeast` dataset with `State` on the x-axis

    ```{r echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(northeast, aes(x = State, y = Home.Value)) +
      geom_boxplot() 
    ```

1. Create a line plot using `newyork` dataset with `Date` on the x-axis and `Home.Value` on the y-axis

    ```{r echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(newyork, aes(x = Date, y = Home.Value)) +
      geom_line()
    ```

1. Create a line plot using `northeast` dataset with `Date` on the x-axis and `Home.Value` on the y-axis and use a different color for each state

    ```{r echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(northeast, aes(x = Date, y = Home.Value, col = State)) +
      geom_line()
    ```
