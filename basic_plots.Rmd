# Basic Plots

## Loading ggplot2

Like any other R package, you must load `ggplot2` using the `library` function before you can use any of the functionality that it offers.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Dataset 

Let's start by loading the housing dataset:

```{r}
housing <- read.csv("./data/landdata-states.csv")
```

Now, let's see what the dataset looks like:

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

## Scatter Plot

Everything starts with the `ggplot()` function which creates a plot object. The two arguments passed to `ggplot()` are:

|Argument |Description|
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|`data`   |Dataset for the plot. It should be a data.frame or something that can be converted to data.frame|
|`mapping`|Aesthetic mappings for the plot|

Now, let's create a scatter plot with `disp` on the x-axis and `mpg` on the y-axis. Both `disp` and `mpg` are continuous variables.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

Now let's see which ggplot building blocks are active in the above example:

## Exercise

Use the [Data Visualization with ggplot2 Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) or any other resource to find out how to complete the exercises.

1. Create a line plot using the same data as above.

1. Create a histogram using the horspower (`hp`) variable and selecting an appropaite bin size for the data.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()

ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25)
```
