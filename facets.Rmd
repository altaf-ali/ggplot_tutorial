# Facets

Let's plot the northeast data again

```{r}
ggplot(northeast, aes(x = Date, y = Home.Value, color = State)) +
  geom_line()
```

But what if we were to plot the entire dataset?

```{r}
ggplot(housing, aes(x = Date, y = Home.Value, color = State)) +
  geom_line()
```

The plot is not very informative anymore. We can use facets to split the plot based on the `State`

```{r}
ggplot(northeast, aes(x = Date, y = Home.Value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~State, ncol = 3)
```
